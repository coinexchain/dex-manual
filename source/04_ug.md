## User Guide

To use CoinEx Chain, you need a wallet to create accounts, keep the private key, view on-chain status and send transactions.

The official command line client `cetcli` is a full-feature open-source wallet. If you are a professional user, we recommend to use it as your default wallet. If you are a developer, its documents and behavior help you to understand how the chain work.

However, if you're a normal user without technology background, it is better to choose a GUI wallet or web wallet, which have friendly user interface.

If you do not have assets on CoinEx Chain and only wants to view on-chain status, a blockchain explorer is enough for you.
