## Introduction

### Overview

CoinEx Chain is a decentralized public chain ecosystem. It has planned three public chains for specific applications: 

1. DEX Chain that supports decentralized exchange functions;

2. Smart Chain that supports smart contract functions;

3. Privacy Chain that supports on-chain privacy protection. 

The CoinEx DEX Chain was first to launch, on 11th Nov 2019. With functions such as asset-mapping, on-chain trading and on-chain matching, it can address the problems of centralized exchanges, such as poor safety and intransparency that have been widely criticized. Returning asset control to users, order-book based fair on-chain matching algorithm, permissionless on-chain creating trading pairs, all these efforts are aimed to build a transparent, secure, and permissionless financial platform for free trading. At the same time, features such as high TPS performance and second-level transaction confirmation provided by the underlying Tendermint Consensus can maximumly restore the user experience as that in centralized exchanges.

The native token for DEX Chain is CoinEx Token (CET). 

### Features

To maximize the transaction processing speed, CoinEx DEX chain limits its functions to the essential ones needed for a decentralized exchange.  You can:

- Send and receive CET
- Issue new tokens to digitalize assets, and use CoinEx Chain as underlying exchange/transfer network for the assets
- Send, receive, burn/mint and lock/unlock tokens
- List/delist trading pairs between two different tokens
- Send orders to buy or sell assets through trading pairs
- Delegate CET to validators and get awards
- Join chain governance through proposals and votes

You can also:

- Explore the transaction history and blocks on the chain, via a chain explorers
- Run a full node to listen to committed blocks and broadcast verified transactions
- Be elected a validator node
- Watch the chain activities in JSON format
- Interact with CoinEx Chain via RESTful APIs
- Develop tools and application for CoinEx Chain ecosystem
